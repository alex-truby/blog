# Welcome!

<img src="/blog/images/cali_doorframe.jpg" alt="Rounded Image" class="about-me-img-rounded2"> 

Hello! I'm Alex. 

I love to nerd out on all things water and climte related, whether that's diving into the technical details, talking about policy, or just day dreaming about what a future in these domains might look like. This passion spills over to my work life, where I'm driving a career in the climate tech space focused on using technology and analytics to tackle water resources and climate related problems. I've worked in the non-profit space tackling the energy transition as part of the ClimateTRACE coalition (I still fan-girl over the fact that Al Gore once tweeted a chart that I made), in start ups focused on water resouces and energy, and spent many years working in various physical engineering roles in the energy space prior to making the career jump to data and analytics. My brain likes to hang out somewhere between big picture thinking (strategy, product, etc.) and diving into the details of the code base myself. This cross-section will likely be very apparent as you explore the contents of this website! I'm pretty big on data storytelling, so hopefully the material here, while technical in nature will be compelling enough to hold you for a bit!

Outside of work, I'm adventurer (cliche, I know). Sometimes that means experiencing new cultures, environments, and food by visiting new countires (30 and counting!). Often times it means spending my weekends outdoors biking, backpacking, climbing, or skiing. My partner and I own a van, which we use to access these outdoor adventures with our two dogs, Dex & Nala. Incorporating these adventures into our life is very important to us! We've both built our careers around a remote work environment that allows us to be a bit more than weekend warriors at times. While working remotely, we've taken the van on adventures ranging from a summer in Alaska, to months in Baja to escape the cold, to a few PNW/British Colombia biking extravaganza summers. Our home base, as much as we have one, is currently in Seattle, WA. In the coming years, we'll be exchanging that for the red rock dreamscape of Castle Valley, UT as we work to  build a home there. Yoga is another big part of my life (I need to stay grounded with this crazy lifestyle somehow), and I'm currently working toward becoming a certified yoga teacher. Maybe I'll see you in class come summer of 2025!

Over the past few years as the remote work + van combination have allowed us to linger a while in the places we visit, I've been driven to learn more about the environment, and environmental challenges, in the places we travel to. Water resources will always be my first love, so that will likely be the main focus of the blogs and projects on this site. 

**My goal with this website is to create a space to showcase my personal technical projects, as well as to tie in some higher level, perhaps non-technical, writing on topics of interest to me**. All of my technical work will be linked to my github. So, whether you are here to take a look at my technical work, or just to explore, I hope you enjoy!

One last fun fact - I've recently purchased a *grown up* camera to document our adventures. All photos you see on this website are my own!
