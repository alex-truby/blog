# Hi, I'm Alex! 

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I love exploring, photographing, and learning about water systems and their interplay with travel and nature.

## Goal:
To share my journey and passion with like-minded individuals.

## Passions
- Water and its conservation.
- Adventure and travel.

## Hobbies
A fun fact - I've recently taken up photography, and all photos you see on this blog are taken by me!
