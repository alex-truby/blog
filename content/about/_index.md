# Welcome!

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I love exploring, photographing, and learning about water systems and their interplay with travel and nature.

## Goal:
To share my journey and passion with like-minded individuals.

## Passions
- Water and its conservation.
- Adventure and travel.
 - I've been to 30 countires now (and, hopefully, counting). I love to travel and try make it a point to learn at least the basics of the language and culture anywhere I go. Now, I have a goal to learn about water resources in the areas I visit. I'm sure I won't be able to dive into *every* region I visit, but I hope to highlight even a fraction of the water and climate issues in the places I visit, I will have accomplished my goal!

## Hobbies
A fun fact - I've recently taken up photography, and all photos you see on this blog are taken by me!
