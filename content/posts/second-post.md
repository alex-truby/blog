## Introduction

This is **bold** text, and this is *emphasized* text.

Visit the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website!

Also, [this page](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) is helpful for getting started with Hugo. 

This is a test to see if I can link to other repositories! 

[Really old Github Project on Chilean Glacier melt](https://github.com/alex-truby/aerial_snow_trends_in_southern_chile).

And this is how I might want to display an image from a project.
