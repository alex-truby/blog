+++

As a water and climate nerd, avid traveler, techie, and novice photographer and writer, I had long been 
wanting to mesh together these personal interests in a way that fosters creativity and learning.

And so, this website was born!

While I do have a rough plan, I'm not quite sure yet where this website will go. I do know that 
it's initial purpose will be to allow me to share my personal interests and projects with those 
who find their way to these pages.

Much of my content will focus on environmental explorations through technology. There will likely
be a strong emphasis on water resources, with some broader energy, environmental, and environmental 
justice (EJ) topics sprinkled in. The technical projects and writing presented in this blog are 
*not* meant to be academic in nature. While I do have an M.S. in water engineering, I'm not planning 
to publish any work here that would be of the same quality as those done in an academic setting. 
The explorations I present on this website are mean to quench my own curiosity for both topics and 
technologies that I am interested in.

There will also be some 'fun' blog posts sprinkled in! These will likely be focused on travel 
writing, but that is yet to be decided! You'll likely be as surprised as I when I publish these
non-technical bits of 'work'. 


So, I hope you enjoy! Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-truby/),
