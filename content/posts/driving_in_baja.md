## Rainbow Road
Driving in Baja is like driving in Mario Cart - but in real life. There is one major highway that snakes across the entire peninsula - Federal Highway 1. This is essentially the ‘rainbow road’ for Baja California. Highway 1 is riddled with potholes, semis blasting around corners in the center of both lanes, cows grazing what little grass is to be found popping up along the highway. Shoulders are essentially non-existent. The general rule of thumb for driving Highway 1 is to go +/- 20 of the posted speed limit - your choice. 

The rules of Bajario Cart on Rainbow Road are as follows:
* Minus 10 if you hit a pothole
* Minus 30 if you hit a pothole and lose a tire
* Plus 10 for every time you pass a normal car
* Plus 30 for every time you semi-blindly pass a semi
* Plus 50 for every time you semi-blindly pass a semi on a hilly or curvy stretch
* Minus 50 for every near head on collision you have with a semi that is taking a turn a little too wide
* Minus 50 for every near head on collision with a cow in the dark

There is no ‘good’ time of day to drive this road, except maybe when there are as few other cars as possible. Daylight certainly makes it easier to spot the cows randomly scattered along the side of the highway, and maybe an extra 2 seconds of brain processing time for the inevitable pothole you’re about to hit. Night gives the semis a bit of a heads up that there is a car coming towards them, so they at least theoretically have time to get fully into their lane before they’re on top of you. When avoiding potholes, it’s generally safer to swerve to the left to try to avoid them. Shoulders don’t often exist on rainbow road, and there is often an unwelcome 6-12 inch drop or something else to puncture a tire waiting for you just off the pavement. 

If you are making the full trek down from North to South in a vehicle, there is one particular stretch of Hwy 1 that is renowned for its desolation - and for its tire casualties. Between El Rosario and Guerrero Negro, there is a stretch of about 220 miles with no gas stations. Naturally, there is no posted signage about this; you just simply must know. I should say, there are no ‘official’ gas stations. A few industrious palapas have popped up to sell gallons of gasoline to the poor souls who entered this dead zone without a full tank. There are also a number of llanteras (tire ‘shops’), for the poor souls who planned ahead for gasoline, but may have let their mind wander a tad too much while driving (minus 30 Bajario points). 

One last note about Hwy 1 - the federales check points. There are a handful of checkpoints spread out along the only main highway on the peninsula. To greet you at each checkpoint are three to four men dressed in camo fatigues, at least one of which will likely be holding some sort of very large gun. You’ll role into the checkpoint and one of three things will happen: 1) you’ll just get a nod and a wave to pass through, 2) they’ll ask you to open the door, take a cursory look inside, ask a few questions and wave you through, or 3) they’ll have you remove your dogs from the vehicle, while one of them enters and opens all compartments and anything that zips or looks like it may be a hiding place for drugs, all the while asking you repeatedly if you smoke marijuana. These checkpoints are harmless, and while intimidating at first, more often than not present a fantastic opportunity to practice your small talk in Spanish!

## In Town

Once you’ve made it to a town, be it a small drive through town along Hwy 1 or a larger city, you are by no means in the clear to default to your ‘normal’ level of ease while driving.

Generally, upon entering a town, there will be a series of speed bumps (“topes”). These may or may not be marked with a warning sign. The tope may be a smooth rolling speed bump like we see in the states. It may also be an abrupt half cylinder cemented to the pavement, resulting in the feeling of driving over a curb when you pass over it. In all cases, it is highly recommended to slow way down before crossing these if you are in a vehicle with loose items that may be easily dislodged (i.e., a van). There are also the fake topes, where the street has been painted to look like a tope, but when you brace for impact, you roll smoothly on by. We’ve found the best way to handle these is to (gently) yell “tope!” whenever one is coming up, just in case it is unmarked, in the shade, or just around a corner. I must say, these topes are far more effective than just lowering the speed limit. 

Next, stop signs. Whether or not you are actually supposed to stop for a stop sign depends entirely on how busy the intersection is. Main road? Sure. Side street? You may get rear ended if you come to a full stop. Best practice is to do a quick cursory glance, or just assume no one is coming on the cross street and continue on your way. Spotting a stop sign, similar to spotting a tope, is a bit like a game of eye spy... the stop sign may be hidden behind a tree, on the opposite side of the street, partially bent backwards, painted gray, or just missing on your side of the four-way intersection.

## Buen Viaje!
Driving in Baja, as with many foreign countries, is certainly an adventure. Doing the full drive from north to south brings you through desert, small towns with bumpin’ taco joints late at night, the occasional oasis riddled with palm trees and more green than you’ve seen for hundreds of miles, and so much more. It’s an incredible experience and is a huge part of ‘doing Baja’ in the van - but be prepared for a crazy, incredible journey on the road.
