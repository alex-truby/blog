Driving in Baja is like driving in Mario Cart - but in real life. Minus 10 points if you hit a pot hole. Don’t drive off rainbow road - there is likely no shoulder before the road drops off into the rough desert landscape riddles with cacti and countless other things that will puncture a tire.

If you are making the full trek down from North to South in a vehicle, there is one particular stretch of Hwy 1 that is renowned for its desolation - and for its tire casualties. There are no gas stations for 150 (?) miles in Northern Baja, just before you cross into Sur. There are however, a few industrious palapas that have popped up to sell gallons of gasoline to the poor souls caught unawares. There are also a number of llanteras (tire ‘shops’), for the poor souls who planned ahead for gasoline, but may have let their mind wander a tad too much while driving. It’s minus 100 points in Baja Mario Cart if the pot hole strike decommissions a full tire as well. 


Whether or not you are actually supposed to stop for a stop sign depends entirely around how busy the intersection is. Main road? Sure. Side street? You may get rear ended if you come to a full stop. Best practice is to do a quick cursory glance, or just assume no one is coming on the intersection street, and continue on your way. These rules should be dis-regarded if you are a gringo and there is a policía nearby. Then you stop (or be prepared to pay a ticket, in cash). Spotting a stop sign is also a bit like a game of eye spy… the stop signs may be hidden behind a tree, on the opposite side of the street, partially bent backwards, or painted gray (+20 if you spot one of those).

Speed limits - also only a recommendation. General rule of thumb outside a side is +- 20 km of the posted suggestion. Unless of course, your a gringo and there is a policía nearby. In which case, go exactly the posted limit, maybe a little under, or be prepared to pay a ticket, in cash.

Most importantly - at all times - be prepared for a ! Tope !
