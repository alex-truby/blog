      <title>Water in Baja California Sur</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Baja California Peninsula is a dry, desolate, dusty, and beautiful desert. Driving the length of the peninsula spans just over a thousand miles from Tijuana to Cabo San Lucas (1,040 miles, to be exact). That’s almost the same distance as driving from San Diego to Portland, Oregon. Having driven both stretches in December 2024, I can tell you the variety in landscapes along each route differs drastically. From Oregon to San Diego, you feel as if you’re passing through three or four different countries—maybe even worlds. There’s the rugged Oregon coast, the towering redwoods of Northern California, the rolling hills of wine country, and the Mediterranean-like landscape of Southern California. Once you cross the border into Baja, however, most signs of moisture dissipate, and you’re left with a rugged, dry landscape for the rest of the drive. It doesn’t take long for your vehicle, clothing, and skin to take on the sandy color of the desert.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Rules of the Road in Baja California</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;rainbow-road&#34;&gt;Rainbow Road&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Driving in Baja is like driving in Mario Cart - but in real life. There is one major highway that snakes across the entire peninsula - Federal Highway 1. This is essentially the ‘rainbow road’ for Baja California. Highway 1 is riddled with potholes, semis blasting around corners in the center of both lanes, cows grazing what little grass is to be found popping up along the highway. Shoulders are essentially non-existent. The general rule of thumb for driving Highway 1 is to go +/- 20 of the posted speed limit - your choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a water and climate nerd, avid traveler, techie, and novice photographer and writer, I had long been&#xA;wanting to mesh together these personal interests in a way that fosters creativity and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And so, this website was born!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I do have a rough plan, I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure yet where this website will go. I do know that&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s initaial purpose will be to allow me to share my personal interests and projects with those&#xA;who find their way to these pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
