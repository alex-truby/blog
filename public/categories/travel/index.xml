      <description>&lt;p&gt;Driving in Baja is like driving in Mario Cart - but in real life. Minus 10 points if you hit a pot hole. Don’t drive off rainbow road - there is likely no shoulder before the road drops off into the rough desert landscape riddles with cacti and countless other things that will puncture a tire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are making the full trek down from North to South in a vehicle, there is one particular stretch of Hwy 1 that is renowned for its desolation - and for its tire casualties. There are no gas stations for 150 (?) miles in Northern Baja, just before you cross into Sur. There are however, a few industrious palapas that have popped up to sell gallons of gasoline to the poor souls caught unawares. There are also a number of llanteras (tire ‘shops’), for the poor souls who planned ahead for gasoline, but may have let their mind wander a tad too much while driving. It’s minus 100 points in Baja Mario Cart if the pot hole strike decommissions a full tire as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
