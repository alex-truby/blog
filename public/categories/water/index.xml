      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;TLDR&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This analysis isn’t an academic study, but rather a curiosity-fueled exploration of water resources in Baja California Sur, a region where I’ve spent exploring for the last two months. Using only publically available tools (GEE and EO datasets) and Python, I analyzed precipitation trends, groundwater anomalies, land surface temperature, vegetation health, and urbanization to better understand water stress in this arid peninsula. While precipitation and groundwater trends point to increasing challenges in the region, stable vegetation indices and the growing use of desalination plants offer some hope. One of the most pressing concerns for the peninsula might be the ever increasing &lt;em&gt;demand&lt;/em&gt; for water, driven by the rapid growth in the southern most region near La Paz and Los Cabos. Ultimately, this project was an opportunity to expand my technical skills, dive deeper into a topic I’m passionate about, and share my findings with others interested in water systems and climate challenges in BCS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
