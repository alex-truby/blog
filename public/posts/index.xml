      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;TLDR&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This analysis isn’t an academic study, but rather a curiosity-fueled exploration of water resources in Baja California Sur, a region where I’ve spent exploring for the last two months. Using only publically available tools (GEE and EO datasets) and Python, I analyzed precipitation trends, groundwater anomalies, land surface temperature, vegetation health, and urbanization to better understand water stress in this arid peninsula. While precipitation and groundwater trends point to increasing challenges in the region, stable vegetation indices and the growing use of desalination plants offer some hope. One of the most pressing concerns for the peninsula might be the ever increasing &lt;em&gt;demand&lt;/em&gt; for water, driven by the rapid growth in the southern most region near La Paz and Los Cabos. Ultimately, this project was an opportunity to expand my technical skills, dive deeper into a topic I’m passionate about, and share my findings with others interested in water systems and climate challenges in BCS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Rules of the Road in Baja California</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;rainbow-road&#34;&gt;Rainbow Road&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Driving in Baja is like driving in Mario Cart - but in real life. There is one major highway that snakes across the entire peninsula - Federal Highway 1. This is essentially the ‘rainbow road’ for Baja California. Highway 1 is riddled with potholes, semis blasting around corners in the center of both lanes, cows grazing what little grass is to be found popping up along the highway. Shoulders are essentially non-existent. The general rule of thumb for driving Highway 1 is to go +/- 20 of the posted speed limit - your choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a water and climate nerd, avid traveler, techie, and novice photographer and writer, I had long been&#xA;wanting to mesh together these personal interests in a way that fosters creativity and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And so, this website was born!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I do have a rough plan, I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure yet where this website will go. I do know that&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s initaial purpose will be to allow me to share my personal interests and projects with those&#xA;who find their way to these pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
